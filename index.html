            I'm currently in my second year pursuing engineering degree in computer science. I'm looking forward to begin intership during summer. My hobbies include macgyvering on my car, reading Introduction to Algorithms in trams on my daily commute, but my true love are computers, since 6th birthday. Now I'm fulfilling my childhod dreams of becoming a programmer.
